Gaia
====

Python library for ecological modelling.

According to Wikipedia:

    In Greek mythology, Gaia was the personification of the Earth and one of
    the Greek primordial deities. Gaia was the great mother of all: the primal
    Greek Mother Goddess; creator and giver of birth to the Earth and all the
    Universe; the heavenly gods, the Titans, and the Giants were born to her.
    The gods reigning over their classical pantheon were born from her union
    with Uranus (the sky), while the sea-gods were born from her union with
    Pontus (the sea). Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.

This software is an attempt to create a framework for ecological models.
